{"basics":{"name":"James Noeckel, PhD","label":"Graphics Software Engineer","image":"","email":"jamesn8@cs.washington.edu","phone":"(541) 513-2856","url":"jamesnoeckel.com","summary":"I obtained my PhD from the GRAIL lab in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Brian Curless and Adriana Schulz. My research has focused reverse engineering 3D designs of objects through the use of domain-specific geometry representations. In particular, I am fascinated by the ability of such representations to enable precise reconstruction with incomplete observations, especially alongside advances in deep learning techniques for 3D vision / shape modeling. I’ve published techniques to recover computer-aided design (CAD) models from measured data.\\n\\nDuring my undergraduate studies at Cornell University, I worked with Kavita Bala on photorealistic cloth rendering and Timur Dogan on large-scale light radiance simulation in urban environments. I also minored in physics; I have retained a particular interest in realtime graphics and physics simulation techniques thanks to my graphics / physics background, with various side projects exploring rendering, physics, and geometry techniques.","location":{"address":"3311 Chaucer Way","postalCode":"OR 97405","city":"Eugene","countryCode":"US","region":"Oregon"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"james-noeckel-b76739129","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-noeckel-b76739129/"}]},"work":[{"name":"Apple","position":"Graphics Software Engineer","url":"https://www.apple.com","startDate":"2025-02-03","summary":"Research and development on core graphics algorithms for cutting-edge rendering techniques."},{"name":"University of Washington","position":"PhD Researcher","url":"https://www.cs.washington.edu/","startDate":"2017-09-01","endDate":"2024-12-31","summary":"Working as part of GRAIL and CDG labs advised by Brian Curless and Adriana Schulz, conducting research on methods for editable scene reconstruction with a focus on reverse engineering designs of manufactured objects.
