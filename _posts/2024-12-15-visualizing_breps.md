The lucky few who attended my [thesis defense](/news/thesis_defense) will have been blown away by my schematic animations illustrating the topology of computer-aided design representations. I actually created a couple of Blender modifiers to make this quite easy for myself (and hopefully, others in the future)---which can be applied to any mesh, with minimal manual intervention. 

Links and additional info will be forthcoming.
