I obtained my PhD from the GRAIL lab in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by [Brian Curless](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~curless/) and [Adriana Schulz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~adriana/). My research has focused reverse engineering 3D designs of objects through the use of domain-specific geometry representations. In particular, I am fascinated by the ability of such representations to enable precise reconstruction with incomplete observations, especially alongside advances in deep learning techniques for 3D vision / shape modeling. I've published techniques to recover computer-aided design (CAD) models from measured data. 

During my undergraduate studies at Cornell University, I worked with [Kavita Bala](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kb/) on photorealistic cloth rendering (providing the realtime shader implementation) and [Timur Dogan](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/timur-dogan) on large-scale light radiance simulation in urban environments. I also minored in physics; I have retained a particular interest in realtime graphics and physics simulation techniques thanks to my graphics / physics background, with various side projects exploring rendering, physics, and geometry techniques, which you can find in my [gallery](/gallery) and on [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/ShnitzelKiller).
